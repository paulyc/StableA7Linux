#StableA7Linux for iOS10.3.3
I come here to release you my beta of the StableA7 port for Linux

Warning: apparently doesn't work on iPads (in momments), only iPhones

Is downgrade for iOS10.3.3 in A7 idevices

What do you need to install?

A Ubuntu / Debian based Linux distro more recent (I recommend Xubuntu 19.10 which I use) , installed, no Live CD

Patience (very important)

A brain (very rare)

Your idevice in DFU mode

*Open Software&Updates (or Software Sources depending on your Linux distro or even Additional Drivers) and enable all sources on the Other Software tab

=> just run:

git clone https://github.com/twilightmoon4/StableA7Linux.git

cd stablea7linux

sudo apt-get update

chmod +x *

=> And then place IPSW renaming for "restore.ipsw" in the folder where StableA7.sh

=> run on terminal :

sudo bash StableA7.sh

=> (Warning, the exploit can be very tiring, so be patient)

Okay, after a long time before the exploit works, and congratulations ! your idevice will be on iOS 10.3.3 <3
